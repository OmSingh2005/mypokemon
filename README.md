# MyPokemon - Pok√©mon Card Duel Game

![Pok√©mon Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200?text=Pokemon+Card+Duel)

A nostalgic card duel game inspired by childhood Pok√©mon card battles. Challenge an AI opponent in a strategic duel where you compare Pok√©mon stats to win cards and ultimately the entire game.

## üéÆ Game Overview

**MyPokemon** is a turn-based card game where:

- Players and AI receive an equal number of Pok√©mon cards
- Each round, the player with the turn selects a stat to compare (HP, Attack, Defense, etc.)
- The card with the higher selected stat wins that round
- The winner of each round collects the opponent's card and gets to choose the stat for the next round
- The game continues until one player has collected all cards

This project brings back the childhood joy of traditional Pok√©mon card games with a digital twist!
